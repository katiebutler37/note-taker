## Description
- The motivation for creating this repository was to small business owners to write and save notes to a server from a user friendly platform.
- This application helps to organize your thoughts and keep track of tasks you need to complete.
- While creating this application, I was able to strengthen existing knowledge of Node.js and JavaScript while applying my newly learned skills of Express.js to link a front-end application to the backend server to store data.
